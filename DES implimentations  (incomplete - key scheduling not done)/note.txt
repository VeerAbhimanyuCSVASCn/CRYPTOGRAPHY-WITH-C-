DES algorithm   : -  (key scheduling yet not completed that's why all three main files are yet not arranged)

feistel_encrypt.cpp will be the main file on whose structure the 2's modulus will be implemented it is in working mode and
 the code and the heart of the programme  s-box (present in 111.cpp) is also successfullly working  


last part of the programme is to be done called..................... key scheduling  and then it can be arranged for successful encryption


the same schemes of codes can be later used for triple DES
